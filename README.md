🐕 Sniffer - The Social Network for Dogs
Sniff. Bark. Match. Confuse.

Finally, a social network for dogs that's more complicated than it needs to be.

About The Project
Sniffer is a satirical, front-end project that imagines a social media app designed exclusively for dogs. It's a humorous take on modern dating apps and social networks, complete with over-the-top features and a quirky design. This project is built with plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create a fun, interactive, and fully client-side web experience.

The entire user experience is filled with dog-related puns, jokes, and absurd scenarios, from matching with a "Quantum Zoomie Specialist" to chatting with a dog who only replies with variations of "WOOF!".

Features
This project is packed with "revolutionary" features:

🐾 Sniff Match™: A Tinder-style card swiping interface where you can "Sniff" (right) or "Pass" (left) on various dog profiles.

😂 Hilarious Dog Profiles: A collection of 15 unique dog profiles with funny names, breeds, and bios, like "Sheru, the CEO of Barks" and "Joota Chor, the Long-Bodied Sock Gremlin".

💬 Woof Chat: A simulated chat interface where you can have confusing conversations with your matches. (Spoiler: You're just talking to yourself).

📊 Impressive (and Fake) Stats: A dashboard showcasing vital metrics like "Sniffed Butts," "Confusion Rate," and "Meaningless Barks".

📰 Live Sniffing Activity: A dynamic feed that constantly updates with the latest comical activities from dogs on the network.

😜 Interactive & Comical UX: The site is full of funny pop-ups, alerts, and notifications that make browsing a delightful experience.

** QR Code Surprise**: A "Download" section with a QR code that leads to a well-known internet meme.

Tech Stack
This project was built from scratch using fundamental web technologies.

HTML5: For the structure and content of the website.

CSS3: For all styling, animations, and the responsive layout. Uses the 'Comic Neue' font for that special touch.

Vanilla JavaScript: For all the interactive logic, including the swiping mechanism, chat functionality, dynamic data, and event handling.
